# MyReads Project

This is the project submission for the Udacity MyReads FEND project. It contains all necessary code and instructions to run and use the project.

## Install and run

To get this project up and running:

* download files provided
* change directory into the project folder
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Dependencies

This project uses the following dependencies:

* React
* react-router-dom
* The provided BooksAPI from Udacity
* Node.js

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).

## Contributing

This repository is the starter code for _all_ Udacity students. Therefore, we most likely will not accept pull requests.
